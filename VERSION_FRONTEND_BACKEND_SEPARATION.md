# Version 2.0.0: Frontend-Backend Separation Release

## Overview
This release marks a major architectural milestone for TriBridge - the complete separation of frontend and backend components. This separation allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component.

## Key Features

### Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- Complete React-based user interface
- Vite for fast development and building
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI components
- Multi-language support (Chinese/English/Russian)
- Dark/Light theme support

### Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
- RESTful API architecture
- Express.js framework
- TypeScript implementation
- Multi-chain blockchain integration (Ethereum, TRON, BSC)
- KYC/AML compliance services
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Redis caching
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

### Integration Points
- Frontend communicates with backend via REST API
- Shared TypeScript interfaces for type consistency
- Environment-based configuration management

## Deployment Architecture
- Frontend can be deployed to static hosting services (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- Backend can be deployed to Node.js hosting services (Heroku, Railway, Docker containers)
- Independent scaling of frontend and backend components
- Microservices-ready architecture

## Benefits of Separation
1. **Independent Development**: Frontend and backend teams can work in parallel
2. **Flexible Deployment**: Each component can be deployed to the most suitable platform
3. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on demand
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Each component can evolve with its own technology stack
5. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update individual components
